# C.ELEGANS
2020 First Python Project playing around with the C.ELEGANS organic neural network.

All the data come from an other github project : https://github.com/openworm, 

more specifically the https://github.com/openworm/c302/blob/master/c302/CElegansNeuronTables.xls file, divided into several CSV files.

The C.Elegans (Caenorhabditis elegans) is a 1 mm  nematode and the only animal with a fully known neural architecture (connectome).

The goal of this project is to visualize the connections occuring within the brain and to highlight some patterns.
